# Joke Teller

**This Web App was made using two different APIs . One that fetches the joke and the other that converts the jokes into speech.**

[JokeAPI](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/) is a RESTful API that serves uniformly and well formatted jokes.
It can be used without any API token, membership, registration or payment.

The [VoiceRSS](http://www.voicerss.org/api/) Text-to-Speech (TTS) API allows conversion of textual content to speech easier than ever. Just connect to their Text-to-Speech (TTS) API with a few lines of code and get verbal representation of a textual content.To use this API you will need an API key which is free of cost( can make 350 daily requests).

The Text-To-Speech API provides a very easy and simple one-line use. Just put the API key and language in the URL and you'll receive an audio data containing the specified text.
